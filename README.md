Food App
========

The purpose of this app is to be my first Rails app from scratch that has some functionality that I have to code myself. Meaning it's not just a static site. 

Functionality
-------------

I want this web app to help me choose what to eat and what groceries I will need to buy in order to make this meal. It will also be able to determine what recipes I can make with the food I have on hand. It's pretty simple, just something to get me working with a database and some models. 

It's a Rails app using the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/ "Foundation") framework.
